🧠 Brainscan AI  – MRI Image Analysis
🔬 About the Project 
This AI-powered model analyzes MRI brain scans to detect the presence of a tumor. Using deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras) and computer vision , our model classifies MRI images as tumor or non-tumor, assisting medical professionals in early diagnosis, 

⚡ Features
✅ Automated MRI Analysis – Upload an MRI image and get instant results.
✅ Deep Learning Model – Trained using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for high accuracy.
✅ Web Interface – Built with Flask, making it easy to use.
✅ Fast & Reliable – Provides accurate tumor predictions in seconds.

📸 How It Works?
1️⃣ Upload an MRI scan image.
2️⃣ The AI model processes the image.
3️⃣ It predicts whether a tumor is present or not.
4️⃣ The result is displayed on the screen.
